# Artificial-face-generator

This is a MAchine learning based face generator model. This model has two parts .. one that extract facial features and one that creates faces from that.
This means this model can generate infinite images of a person's face. I have made it to make memes of my friends .

# USING MODEL :
 There are 3 models (2 basically).<br>
 1. feature extractor : Use this to extract facial feeatures of any perosns face . 
 2. generator : takes facial features and generates a face from that. <H>You can generate almost infinite faces of a person from one image</H>.
